       #     # Assume compliance_data is a Foundry dataset with features and labels
       #     # ... data preprocessing and feature engineering steps ...
       #     # ... model training logic (e.g., using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch integrated with Foundry) ...
       #     # Example:
       #     # from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
       #     # model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, class_weight='balanced')
       #     # model.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # # Assume 'dataset_true' contains the original dataset with true labels
     # # Assume 'dataset_pred' contains the dataset with model-predicted labels
     # # privileged_groups and unprivileged_groups are defined based on sensitive attributes
     #
     # # metric_pred = ClassificationMetric(dataset_true, dataset_pred,
     # #                                  unprivileged_groups=unprivileged_groups,
     # #                                  privileged_groups=privileged_groups)
     # # disparate_impact_ratio = metric_pred.disparate_impact()
     # # print(f"Disparate Impact: {disparate_impact_ratio}")
     # # if disparate_impact_ratio < 0.8 or disparate_impact_ratio > 1.25:

**C. ROI Calculation (Illustrative for a 5-Year Horizon)**

To calculate a meaningful ROI, we need to project further, as Year 3 is still showing net investment. Let's assume by Year 5, annual revenue reaches \$15M and annual operational costs stabilize at \$5M (excluding initial heavy development).

- **Cumulative Costs (5 Years, illustrative projection):** \$17.8M (Years 1-3) + \$5M (Year 4 Ops) + \$5M (Year 5 Ops) = **\$27.8M**
- **Cumulative Revenue (5 Years, illustrative projection):** \$8.275M (Years 1-3) + \$10M (Year 4 Revenue) + \$15M (Year 5 Revenue) = **\$33.275M**
- **Net Profit (5 Years):** \$33.275M - \$27.8M = **\$5.475M**
- **Simple ROI (5 Years):** (Net Profit / Total Cost) × 100 = (\$5.475M / \$27.8M) × 100 = **19.69%**

The initial example ROI of 305% (Net Profit \$22.6M / Cost \$7.4M) appears to be based on either a longer timeframe or more aggressive adoption/revenue assumptions beyond the initial 3 years. The key takeaway is that the platform is expected to become highly profitable once established.

**Key ROI Drivers for TJC**:

- **Subscription Revenue**: Scalable and recurring income stream.
- **Market Differentiation**: Attracting more organizations to TJC programs overall.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reducing internal costs for conducting accreditations.
- **Strategic Value**: Positioning TJC as an innovator and leader in the AI-driven healthcare quality space.

**Value Proposition for Hospitals (Drives Adoption & TJC's Revenue)**:

- **Significant reduction in accreditation preparation costs.**
- **Lower risk of CMS penalties and other fines.** (A single large penalty avoided can pay for the platform many times over.)
- **Improved patient safety and quality outcomes.**
- **Staff time freed up and reallocated to patient care and quality improvement.**
